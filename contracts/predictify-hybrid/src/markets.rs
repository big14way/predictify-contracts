/// - Market helper utilities and testing functions
/// - Market resolution and dispute handling

// ===== MARKET CREATION =====

/// Market creation utilities for the Predictify prediction market platform.
///
/// This struct provides methods to create different types of prediction markets
/// with various oracle configurations. All market creation functions validate
/// input parameters and handle fee processing automatically.
